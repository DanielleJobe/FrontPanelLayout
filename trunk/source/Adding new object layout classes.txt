To add a new Object Layout class:

1. Create a new class inside "NI_SE_Front Panel Layout.lvlib".
2. Make the class inherit from Object Layout.lvclass, or one of its descendant classes.
3. Save the class in a new folder under "\Front Panel Layout\Object Layout Classes\".
4. Add an instance of the new class to the diagram of "Object Layout Classes.vi", and make sure it is wired to the build array function.
