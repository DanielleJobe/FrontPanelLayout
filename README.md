###Overview:
The Front Panel Layout Tool provides the ability to use a single VI’s front panel with various different window sizes and layout configurations.  This is useful when you want to use one VI as a user interface, which can be used on multiple monitors of different screen resolutions.  The tool stores the position and size information of every front panel object in a configuration file next to the VI.  When the VI is loaded, it can size itself and all its front panel objects based on whichever configuration file is present.
 
###Repository Overview:
The master branch contains the current release of the code. The "trunk" folder contains the development source.
 

###Build Process:
The code may be built using the VI Package Build Specification located at ../trunk/source/LabVIEW/

1. Fork this repository into your account.
2. Create a branch for your change.
3. Make changes, periodically pulling and merging any updates from the central repository.
4. Push your changes up to your branch in your copy of the repository.
5. Send a pull request to the owner of this primary repository. Follow the contribution guidelines.
 
###Contribution Guidelines:
- Limit the scope of your change as much as possible. Smaller changes are easier to process. Any major changes should be discussed beforehand with the managers of the repository to ensure that it fits within the goals and vision of the project.
- Explain the reason for your change with as much detail as possible. If it is a bugfix, link it to an issue in the issues tracker. If it is an enhancement, consider making an issue in the issue tracker to discuss the enhancement before making it. This ensures that the enhancement will provide value to other users.
- Run through the style guidelines and any available VI analyzer tests to ensure compliance with the general style of the project. Don't go crazy trying to make the code perfect. Do make sure there are no glaring issues.
- Before committing a change, be sure to rebase or merge your code off of the most up-to-date source in the master. This reduces the risk of merge conflicts and makes it that much easier to merge your pull request and that much more likely that the change will be accepted.
- Ensure that all builds are successful with your change in place, after rebasing.
- Ensure that all tests pass with your change in place, after rebasing.
